INTERVIEWER: Hi, thanks for joining. Can you tell me about your experience?

CANDIDATE: Um, yeah, so like, I've done some stuff with AI, you know? I mean, I tried ChatGPT once and it was pretty cool, I guess.

INTERVIEWER: Can you be more specific about your technical experience?

CANDIDATE: Well, uh, I haven't really worked with code much, but I'm a fast learner, I think. I mean, how hard can it be, right?

INTERVIEWER: Have you worked with Python or any machine learning frameworks?

CANDIDATE: Python? Um, like the snake? Just kidding. No, not really. But I watched some YouTube videos about it.

INTERVIEWER: I see. What interests you about this role?

CANDIDATE: Honestly, um, I just need a job. And AI seems like it pays well, you know? Everyone's talking about it.

INTERVIEWER: What do you know about our company?

CANDIDATE: Your company? Um, you do AI stuff? I didn't really have time to look at your website, to be honest.

INTERVIEWER: Okay. Do you have any questions for me?
