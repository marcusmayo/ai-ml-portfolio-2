def analyze_image():
    try:
        # Validate file type and size
        file = request.files.get('image')
        if not file or not allowed_file(file.filename):
            return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid file type'}), 400
            
        # Log all access attempts for audit trail
        logging.info(f"Image analysis request from {request.remote_addr}")
        
        # Process with Google Vision API
        image_content = file.read()
        vision_client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()
        
        # Multi-modal analysis
        objects = detect_objects(vision_client, image_content)
        text = detect_text(vision_client, image_content) 
        faces = count_faces_safely(vision_client, image_content)
        
        return jsonify({
            'objects': objects,
            'text_found': text,
            'people_count': faces,
            'confidence': calculate_avg_confidence(objects),
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        })
        
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Analysis failed: {str(e)}")
        return jsonify({'error': 'Analysis failed'}), 500
```

**Frontend (Modern Web Technologies):**
```javascript
async function analyzeImage() {
    const fileInput = document.getElementById('imageInput');
    const file = fileInput.files[0];
    
    if (!file) {
        alert('Please select an image first!');
        return;
    }
    
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('image', file);
    
    try {
        showLoading(true);
        const response = await fetch('/analyze', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: formData
        });
        
        const results = await response.json();
        displayResults(results);
        updateDashboard(results);
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Analysis failed:', error);
        alert('Analysis failed. Please try again.');
    } finally {
        showLoading(false);
    }
}
```
